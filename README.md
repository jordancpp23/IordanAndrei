Hello there! I'm @IordanAndrei, but you can call me Jordan. I'm currently studying CS at the University of Bucharest, I can use C++14 and C# 
and I'm currently getting better at Python and Assembly. I'd like to contribute to some open source software in order to get some working experience. You can contact me here,
or through an email at jordan.cpp23@gmail.com .
